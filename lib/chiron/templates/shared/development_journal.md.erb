## <%= Date.today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') %> - Initial Setup
**Developer(s)**: <%= @user_name %> & Claude Code | **Branch**: main | **Context**: Project initialization

### What Was Done
<% if @project_type == :rails %>
- Initialized Rails <%= defined?(Rails) ? Rails.version : "8.0+" %> application
- Set up Claude workflow with Chiron gem
- Created initial project structure
- Configured development environment

### Why It Was Done
- Starting new Rails project with AI-assisted development workflow
- Establishing consistent development patterns from the beginning
- Setting up for collaborative development

### Technical Details
- Rails <%= defined?(Rails) ? Rails.version : "8.0+" %> with PostgreSQL database
- Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for frontend interactivity
- TailwindCSS for styling
- RSpec for testing framework
- Claude AI workflow integration

### Results
- ✅ Rails application created and running
- ✅ Claude workflow initialized with commands and templates
- ✅ Development journal started
- ✅ Git repository initialized

### Next Steps
- Configure database and run initial migrations
- Set up continuous integration
- Implement initial models based on requirements
- Create first PRD for core functionality
