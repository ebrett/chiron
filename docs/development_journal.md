## 2025-01-21 - Initial Setup and Module Rename

### What was accomplished today:
- Set up complete gem development infrastructure
- Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore
- Created comprehensive RSpec test suite (5 tests, all passing)
- Set up GitHub Actions CI for Ruby 3.0-3.3
- Added CHANGELOG.md and MIT LICENSE
- Updated README with chiron branding and examples
- Added RuboCop configuration and fixed style issues
- Renamed module from `ClaudeRailsSetup` to `Chiron` throughout codebase
- Updated email to GitHub no-reply address
- Added Claude workflows to the gem itself (meta!)

### Technical decisions made:
- **Module Naming**: Changed from `ClaudeRailsSetup` to `Chiron` for better branding
- **File Structure**: Moved `lib/claude_rails_setup/` to `lib/chiron/`
- **Testing Strategy**: Used temporary directories and mocked TTY::Prompt for CLI tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with matrix testing across Ruby versions
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop with single quotes, 120 character line length

### Bugs fixed:
- Fixed missing `Date` require in CLI for ERB template processing
- Fixed missing `version` method in CLI class
- Updated all module references after rename
- Fixed test directory handling by using `Dir.chdir` instead of mocking

### Features added:
- Complete gem development infrastructure
- Module rename from old name to Chiron
- Self-hosting: Added Claude workflows to the gem itself using its own templates

### Code quality metrics:
- RSpec: 5 examples, 0 failures
- RuboCop: 15 minor style violations (mostly method length, acceptable for CLI)
- Test Coverage: CLI functionality well covered

### Next steps:
- Create GitHub repository and push code
- Test gem building and installation
- Consider adding more comprehensive CLI tests
- Add contribution guidelines
- Prepare for RubyGems publishing

### Notes:
- The gem now "eats its own dog food" by using Claude workflows for its own development
- All original functionality preserved during module rename
- Ready for GitHub publication and RubyGems release
