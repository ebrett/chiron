## 2025-07-01 - Enhancement: Claude Code Best Practices Integration
**Developer(s)**: Claude Code | **Branch**: main | **Context**: User research into Claude Code best practices

### What was accomplished today:
- **Template Enhancement**: Updated Rails and Python CLAUDE.md templates with best practices from https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices
- **Extended Thinking Integration**: Added "think" triggers to workflow templates for complex problem solving
- **Test Verification Focus**: Enhanced TDD template to emphasize test failure verification before implementation
- **New Workflow Templates**: Created comprehensive Explore-Plan-Code-Commit and Visual Iteration workflows
- **Tool Permissions Guidance**: Added tool customization sections to help developers manage Claude Code permissions
- **Documentation Improvements**: Added quick documentation tips and conversational Q&A guidance

### Technical decisions made:
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Modified existing templates rather than replacing them to maintain backward compatibility
- **Best Practice Integration**: Incorporated structured workflows (Explore-Plan-Code-Commit) recommended by Anthropic
- **Visual Development Support**: Added dedicated workflow for screenshot-driven UI development
- **Test Quality Focus**: Enhanced TDD workflow to prevent test overfitting and ensure proper failure verification

### Implementation details:
- **Updated Templates**: Both `rails/CLAUDE.md.erb` and `python/CLAUDE.md.erb` now include tool permissions, extended thinking, and visual development guidance
- **New Workflow Files**: 
  - `explore-plan-code-commit.md` - Structured development process
  - `visual-iteration.md` - Screenshot-driven UI development
- **Enhanced TDD**: Updated `test-driven.md` with failure verification and overfitting prevention
- **Quality Assurance**: All 41 tests continue to pass, ensuring no breaking changes

### Files modified:
- `lib/chiron/templates/rails/CLAUDE.md.erb` - Added best practices sections
- `lib/chiron/templates/python/CLAUDE.md.erb` - Added best practices sections  
- `lib/chiron/templates/shared/commands/workflows/create-prd.md` - Added extended thinking trigger
- `lib/chiron/templates/shared/commands/quality/test-driven.md` - Enhanced with failure verification
- `lib/chiron/templates/shared/commands/workflows/explore-plan-code-commit.md` - New comprehensive workflow
- `lib/chiron/templates/shared/commands/workflows/visual-iteration.md` - New UI development workflow

## 2025-07-01 - Major Enhancement: Comprehensive Python Project Support
**Developer(s)**: Claude Code | **Branch**: main | **Context**: User request for Python support

### What was accomplished today:
- **Major Feature Release**: Added complete Python project support to Chiron gem
- **Framework Detection**: Implemented auto-detection for Django, FastAPI, Flask, and generic Python projects
- **Architecture Overhaul**: Created `ProjectConfig` class for language-agnostic tool management
- **Template Reorganization**: Restructured templates into `rails/`, `python/`, and `shared/` directories
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Expanded test suite from 5 to 41 tests with full Python coverage
- **Documentation Update**: Enhanced README, CHANGELOG, and CLI help with Python examples
- **RubyGems Publication**: Successfully published version 0.2.0 to RubyGems

### Technical decisions made:
- **Multi-Language Architecture**: Designed extensible system supporting both Rails and Python
- **Project Detection**: Auto-detects project type via `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`
- **Framework Intelligence**: Identifies Django (`manage.py`), FastAPI/Flask (via requirements analysis)
- **Template Strategy**: Shared workflows with language-specific conventions and patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained 100% compatibility with existing Rails functionality
- **Configuration Management**: `ProjectConfig` class abstracts tool selection (pytest vs RSpec, black vs RuboCop)

### Features added:
- **Python CLI Options**: `--type=python`, `--with-django`, `--with-fastapi` flags
- **Smart Project Detection**: Interactive prompts for unknown project types
- **Python Workflow Templates**:
  - Python Conventions (PEP 8, type hints, async patterns, framework best practices)
  - Python Testing (pytest patterns, fixtures, mocking, async testing, CI/CD)
  - Python Debugging (pdb workflows, logging strategies, performance profiling)
  - Python Refactoring (SOLID principles, design patterns, code organization)
  - Flask Development (blueprints, forms, testing, deployment patterns)
- **Framework-Specific Content**: Dynamic CLAUDE.md templates based on detected frameworks
- **Project-Specific Tips**: Contextual setup guidance after initialization

### Code quality metrics:
- **RSpec**: 41 examples, 0 failures (8x increase in test coverage)
- **New Test Categories**: Framework detection, ProjectConfig functionality, Python workflows
- **RuboCop**: 29 minor offenses (mostly method length in CLI - acceptable for feature-rich CLI)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing Rails tests continue to pass

### Architecture improvements:
- **Template Structure**: 
  ```
  lib/chiron/templates/
  ├── rails/           # Rails-specific templates
  ├── python/          # Python-specific templates  
  └── shared/          # Language-agnostic workflows
  ```
- **Language Detection**: Robust project type identification with fallback mechanisms
- **Tool Configuration**: Abstracted command generation for testing, linting, formatting
- **ERB Enhancement**: Framework-aware template rendering with conditional content

### Bugs fixed:
- **Template Fallbacks**: Graceful handling when project-specific templates don't exist
- **CLI Robustness**: Improved error handling for unknown project types
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensured Python detection works across different package managers

### Version and release:
- **Version Bump**: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 (major feature enhancement)
- **Gem Build**: Successfully built `chiron-0.2.0.gem`
- **RubyGems**: Published to RubyGems registry
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive CHANGELOG with technical details

### Impact and usage:
- **Multi-Language Support**: Chiron now serves both Rails and Python ecosystems
- **Framework Coverage**: Django, FastAPI, Flask, and generic Python projects supported
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-detection eliminates manual configuration
- **Workflow Richness**: Language-specific best practices and patterns included

### Next steps:
- Monitor RubyGems adoption and user feedback
- Consider additional language support (Node.js, Go, etc.)
- Enhance framework detection with more sophisticated analysis
- Add more Python-specific workflow templates based on community needs
- Create video documentation showing Python project initialization

### Notes:
- This represents the largest enhancement to Chiron since its creation
- Successfully maintained backward compatibility while adding major new functionality
- Python support is comprehensive and production-ready
- Architecture now supports easy addition of future languages

## 2025-01-21 - Initial Setup and Module Rename
**Developer(s)**: Claude Code | **Branch**: main | **Context**: Initial gem development

### What was accomplished today:
- Set up complete gem development infrastructure
- Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore
- Created comprehensive RSpec test suite (5 tests, all passing)
- Set up GitHub Actions CI for Ruby 3.0-3.3
- Added CHANGELOG.md and MIT LICENSE
- Updated README with chiron branding and examples
- Added RuboCop configuration and fixed style issues
- Renamed module from `ClaudeRailsSetup` to `Chiron` throughout codebase
- Updated email to GitHub no-reply address

### Technical decisions made:
- **Module Naming**: Changed from `ClaudeRailsSetup` to `Chiron` for better branding
- **File Structure**: Moved `lib/claude_rails_setup/` to `lib/chiron/`
- **Testing Strategy**: Used temporary directories and mocked TTY::Prompt for CLI tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with matrix testing across Ruby versions
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop with single quotes, 120 character line length

### Bugs fixed:
- Fixed missing `Date` require in CLI for ERB template processing
- Fixed missing `version` method in CLI class
- Updated all module references after rename
- Fixed test directory handling by using `Dir.chdir` instead of mocking

### Features added:
- Complete gem development infrastructure
- Module rename from old name to Chiron
- Self-hosting: Added Claude workflows to the gem itself using its own templates

- RSpec: 5 examples, 0 failures
- RuboCop: 15 minor style violations (mostly method length, acceptable for CLI)
- Test Coverage: CLI functionality well covered

### Next steps:
- Create GitHub repository and push code
- Test gem building and installation
- Consider adding more comprehensive CLI tests
- Add contribution guidelines
- Prepare for RubyGems publishing

### Notes:
- The gem now "eats its own dog food" by using Claude workflows for its own development
